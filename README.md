# Tutorial: GraphQL Nexus, Apollo Server, Prisma ORM
This will form the basis of a (yet to be written) tutorial demonstrating how to build a GraphQL based web service API following a TDD process. The core tech stack will feature GraphQL Nexus, Apollo Server and Prisma ORM.

The tutorial will show how simple it is (using these tools) to progressively adopt TypeScript and reap the benefits of static type checking during development.
